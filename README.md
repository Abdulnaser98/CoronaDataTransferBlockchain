#### Abstract
* Currently the information about covid 19 get transmitted in the following way:  

  * Reporting entities [doctors, laboratories, schools, elderly care centers] send the data to the health department: 
      * transmission often happens through the fax ,sometimes over phone or mail 
      * laboratories have to use DEMIS.
  * The health department then sends the information to the RKI.

* Delays in the transmission happens because of :

  * high workload of the health departments.
  * the by law forced transmission time is slow
  * manual work in the health departments.
